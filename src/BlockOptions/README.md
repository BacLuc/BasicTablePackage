# The BlockOptions Folder /src/BlockOptions
That we can use the FieldTypes implemented for the basic_table_block_packaged for the configuration of the Blocks, the Blockoptions are implemented as Entites.
We have the base class TableBlockOption, which is linked to the BasicTableInstance. The other Block Options extend this base BlockOption.
