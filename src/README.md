# The Source Folder src
Here is everything that is related to Models, BlockOptions, DiscriminatorEntry and FieldTypes.
For further docs on the different files, please read the README's of the folders
 * [BlockOptions](BlockOptions/README.md)  
 * [DiscriminatorEntry](DiscriminatorEntry/README.md)  
 * [EntityViews](EntityViews/README.md)  
 * [Exceptions](Exceptions/README.md)  
 * [FieldTypes](FieldTypes/README.md)

Here is the documentation about the files which are directly in this folder.
First, from here on, the modified PSR4 standard is not guilty anymore. From the src folder (Which has the namespace \Concrete\Package\BasicTablePackage\Src)
on, the file paths and the namespaces have to be the same. Thats why the directories here have uppercase letters.
